Why the name? Fun? ðŸŽŠ Yes, but primarily to avoid namespace collision which happens when attempting to use Laravel's
WorkOS package and WorkOS's PHP SDK.

At current this package only covers what I am using so far which **will** likely expand quickly, but happy to accept
PRs. :)
No SSO yet because the current project isn't multi-tenant but the next is.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
  composer require shavonn/laravel-werkos
```

WorkOS creds in `services.php`.

```php
    'workos' => [
        'client_id' => env('WORKOS_CLIENT_ID'),
        'secret' => env('WORKOS_API_KEY'),
    ],
```

If you are just adding WorkOS, you can publish and run this migration:

```bash
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-werkos-migrations"
    php artisan migrate
```

It will add the `workos_id` and `avatar` columns to the `users` table and set the `password` column to nullable. You can
also
drop the `password` column if you don't need to migrate users.

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-werkos-config"
```

## Usage

### Wrapped for convenience

These methods are wrapped to include reference to config values. You'll still want to
use [WorkOS API Reference](https://workos.com/docs/reference) for direction on use.

#### Sb\LaravelWerkOs\UserManagement

```php
use Sb\LaravelWerkos\LaravelWerkos\UserManagement;
(new UserManagement)->getAuthorizationUrl(...args);
// or
use Sb\LaravelWerkos\LaravelWerkos;
LaravelWerkos::userManager()->getAuthorizationUrl();
```

Currently covered methods:

- getAuthorizationUrl
- authenticateWithCode
- authenticateWithPassword
- getLogoutUrl
- getJwksUrl

### Auth Form Requests

I created these Laravel Form Requests to handle auth types and manage the local Laravel auth session.

#### WorkOsAuthFormRequest

`WorkOsAuthFormRequest` is an abstract with an `attempt` method which calls two other methods on form requests that
extend
it-- `authenticate` and `handleMissingLocalUser`, so you can use it create and customize your own auth methods and
session management. When successful, `attempt` will return a user. Else, it will throw an error.

In a controller:

```php
public function authMe(WorkOsPasswordAuthRequest $request) {
    $request->attempt();
    // handle the success or failure however you like
}
```

Current list of existing requests and what they handle:

#### WorkOsPasswordAuthRequest

- Contains basic email and password validation.
- Wrapped in the Laravel login rate limiting logic (untested).
- Authenticates email and password with WorkOS `authenticateWithPassword` and passes in `ipAddress`, and `userAgent`
  args.

#### WorkOsProviderAuthUrlRequest

- Gets an authorization Url for a provider with `getAuthorizationUrl`, expects `provider` (provider ID from WorkOS docs)
  as a url param. `auth/{provider}/gimme-url` or
  however you like.
- Creates a state val, sends it in url request, and stores it in the Laravel session for later verification.

#### WorkOsAuthUrlCallbackRequest

- This request handles the callback from interacting with an authorization url.
- It will retrieve the `code` and `state` value from the url query string as provided by WorkOS.
- It will authenticate with `authenticateWithCode`, using `code`, `ipAddress`, and `userAgent` args.
- Can create new user if local Laravel user not found. Configuration for this in this package's config file.
    - If enabled, a user will be created, Registered event fired, and user authenticated.

### Utils

#### LaravelWerkOs::userManager

#### LaravelWerkOs::retrieveWorkOsSessionId

#### LaravelWerkOs::getDecodedWorkOsSession

#### LaravelWerkOs::getJwks

## TODOs

- Add other auth methods
    - SSO
    - support organizations
    - add caching where useful
    - create auth request stubs for publishing

## Testing

None right now.

```bash
  composer test
```
